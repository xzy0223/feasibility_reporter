# Feasibility Report: Adding Video Understanding Functionality to Live Streaming on AWS with Amazon S3

## 1. Executive Summary

This report analyzes the feasibility of incorporating video understanding capabilities into the existing Live Streaming on AWS with Amazon S3 solution. By integrating AWS services such as Amazon Rekognition, we can significantly enhance the live streaming functionality to include real-time content analysis, metadata generation, content moderation, and more. These enhancements will provide users with a richer live streaming experience while offering powerful analytical tools for content creators and platform operators.

## 2. Current Architecture Overview

The Live Streaming on AWS with Amazon S3 solution currently utilizes the following key components:

- Amazon S3: Stores and distributes video segments and playlist files
- AWS Elemental MediaLive: Encodes live video streams
- AWS Elemental MediaPackage: Packages video for streaming
- Amazon CloudFront: Distributes video streams
- Amazon API Gateway: Provides REST API endpoints
- AWS Lambda: Processes API requests and runs encoding jobs
- Amazon DynamoDB: Stores stream data
- Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors performance and sets alarms

The solution currently supports four input types: RTP_PUSH, RTMP_PUSH, URL_PULL, and INPUT_DEVICE (for AWS Elemental Link).

## 3. Proposed Video Understanding Enhancements

To add video understanding capabilities, we propose integrating the following new components and features:

### 3.1 Amazon Rekognition Integration

- Create new AWS Lambda functions to invoke Amazon Rekognition Video API for real-time video analysis
- Configure Lambda functions to process video segments as they are created in S3
- Implement Rekognition Video API calls for:
  - Object detection
  - Face recognition
  - Text detection
  - Activity recognition
  - Content moderation

Example pseudocode for Rekognition integration:

```python
import boto3

rekognition_client = boto3.client('rekognition')

def analyze_video_segment(bucket, key):
    response = rekognition_client.start_label_detection(
        Video={'S3Object': {'Bucket': bucket, 'Name': key}},
        MinConfidence=90
    )
    job_id = response['JobId']
    
    # Poll for job completion and process results
    while True:
        response = rekognition_client.get_label_detection(JobId=job_id)
        if response['JobStatus'] == 'SUCCEEDED':
            process_labels(response['Labels'])
            break
        time.sleep(5)

def process_labels(labels):
    # Process and store label data
    pass
```

### 3.2 Metadata Generation and Storage

- Extend the existing DynamoDB schema to store video analysis metadata
- Create a new Lambda function to process Rekognition results and store metadata in DynamoDB
- Implement a mechanism to associate metadata with video segments using timestamps

Example DynamoDB schema extension:

```json
{
  "StreamId": "string",
  "Timestamp": "number",
  "VideoSegmentKey": "string",
  "Labels": [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Confidence": "number",
      "Timestamp": "number"
    }
  ],
  "Faces": [
    {
      "BoundingBox": {
        "Width": "number",
        "Height": "number",
        "Left": "number",
        "Top": "number"
      },
      "Timestamp": "number"
    }
  ],
  "ContentModeration": {
    "ModerationLabels": [
      {
        "Name": "string",
        "Confidence": "number",
        "Timestamp": "number"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Real-time Analysis Processing

- Develop new Lambda functions to aggregate and process real-time analysis data from Rekognition results
- Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream analysis data to Amazon Elasticsearch Service for indexing and querying

Pseudocode for real-time analysis processing:

```python
import boto3

firehose_client = boto3.client('firehose')

def process_analysis_data(analysis_result):
    # Aggregate and format analysis data
    formatted_data = format_analysis_data(analysis_result)
    
    # Send data to Kinesis Data Firehose
    firehose_client.put_record(
        DeliveryStreamName='VideoAnalysisStream',
        Record={'Data': json.dumps(formatted_data)}
    )

def format_analysis_data(analysis_result):
    # Format analysis data for Elasticsearch
    pass
```

### 3.4 Searchable Video Archive

- Integrate Amazon Elasticsearch Service to index and make video metadata searchable
- Develop new API endpoints in API Gateway for video content search functionality

Example Elasticsearch mapping:

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "streamId": { "type": "keyword" },
      "timestamp": { "type": "date" },
      "labels": {
        "type": "nested",
        "properties": {
          "name": { "type": "keyword" },
          "confidence": { "type": "float" }
        }
      },
      "faces": {
        "type": "nested",
        "properties": {
          "boundingBox": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "width": { "type": "float" },
              "height": { "type": "float" },
              "left": { "type": "float" },
              "top": { "type": "float" }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.5 Automatic Caption Generation

- Integrate Amazon Transcribe into the video processing pipeline
- Store generated captions alongside video segments in S3
- Modify the video player to support caption display

Pseudocode for caption generation:

```python
import boto3

transcribe_client = boto3.client('transcribe')

def generate_captions(bucket, key):
    job_name = f"transcribe-{bucket}-{key}"
    job_uri = f"s3://{bucket}/{key}"
    
    transcribe_client.start_transcription_job(
        TranscriptionJobName=job_name,
        Media={'MediaFileUri': job_uri},
        MediaFormat='mp4',
        LanguageCode='en-US',
        OutputBucketName=bucket,
        OutputKey=f"{key}-captions.json"
    )
    
    # Poll for job completion and process results
    while True:
        status = transcribe_client.get_transcription_job(TranscriptionJobName=job_name)
        if status['TranscriptionJob']['TranscriptionJobStatus'] in ['COMPLETED', 'FAILED']:
            break
        time.sleep(5)
    
    if status['TranscriptionJob']['TranscriptionJobStatus'] == 'COMPLETED':
        process_captions(bucket, f"{key}-captions.json")

def process_captions(bucket, key):
    # Process and store caption data
    pass
```
